# AVL Tree
Named after Adelson-Velsky and Landis, an AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree.

This AVL Tree accepts Integer values.

## Implemented
### Insert
Adds a node (as a leaf) to the tree, then checks for and performs any needed rebalancing.  

### Search
Checks if the tree contains a value, and returns the node containing that value.
If the tree doesn't contain the value, it'll return a nullptr.
